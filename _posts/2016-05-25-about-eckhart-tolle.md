Best-selling author and spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle has been inspiring readers since he wrote the number one New York Times best-seller_The Power of Now_. Before class begins, get to know the man who will be guiding you toward spiritual awakening.

Eckhart Tolle was born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. At 29, he says a profound inner transformation radically changed the course of his life. He spent the next few years devoted to understanding, integrating and deepening that transformation, which he says marked the beginning of an intense inward journey. While in London, he also began to work with individuals and small groups as a counselor and spiritual teacher. Since 1995, he has lived in Vancouver, Canada. _The Power of Now_ made its American debut in 1999 and has since been translated into 33 languages.

Eckhart is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition. Through his writing and seminars, his simple yet profound teachings have already helped countless people throughout the world find inner peace and greater fulfillment in their lives.

At the core of his teachings lies the transformation of consciousness---a spiritual awakening that he sees as the next step in human evolution. An essential aspect of this awakening consists of transcending our ego-based state of consciousness. This, he says, is a prerequisite not only for personal happiness but also for the ending of violent conflict endemic on our planet.

A sought-after public speaker and teacher, Eckhart travels throughout the world. Most of the talks are given in English, but occasionally Eckhart speaks in German and Spanish. Many of his talks, intensives and retreats are published on CD and DVD.
